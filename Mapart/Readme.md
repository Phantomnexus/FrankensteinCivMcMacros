# Directions to use

Place your Map art schematic turn on printing mode.
Reduce printing mode range to 2 or 1 blocks(can be more for maparts with less shades).


‐-------------------------------‐-----------------------------


● Put 4 chests stacked on top of each other nearby any border of the farm full of all 16 shades of carpets.

● If your mapart uses less than 2 stacks of a shade remove it from carpet list in the script and have that amount of carpet of that shade in your inventory.

● If your mapart doesn't use a shade then remove the carpet from the list in the script.

● If in your mapart one shade is repeated very frequently then change the the minimum amount to what you think will be suitable.
